# Weightlifting Technique Analyst (WTA)

## Overview

The Weightlifting Technique Analyst (WTA) is a multi-agent application designed to analyze Olympic weightlifting techniques from user-uploaded videos. It provides detailed feedback, identifies areas for improvement.

## Features

* **Video Analysis:**
    * Upload and analyze videos of snatch and clean & jerk lifts.
    * Uses computer vision:
      *  Pose estimation to extract key joint movements.
      *  Object tracking to track barbell movement.
    * Generates textual descriptions of movement patterns.
* **Multi-Agent System:**
    * **Technique Analyzer Agent:**
        * Retrieves relevant information from a knowledge base (guidelines, expert advice, biomechanics).
        * Generates detailed technique analysis using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
    * **Feedback Generator Agent:**
        * Translates analysis into actionable feedback and personalized drills.
        * Provides feedback in various tones.
    * **RAGAS Evaluator Agent (Future work):**
        * Evaluates the quality of feedback using RAGAS metrics (faithfulness, relevancy).
        * Provides data to fine tune the embedding model.
    * **Embedding Model Fine-tuning (Future work):** 
        * Continuously improves retrieval accuracy based on RAGAS feedback.
* **User Interface:**
    * User-friendly interface for video uploads and feedback viewing.
    * Visualization of bar paths and joint angles.

## Technologies Used

* **Computer Vision:** MediaPipe
* **Large Language Models (LLMs):** GPT-4 through OpenAI
* **Multi-agent framework:** [Agno](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno)
* Python, and a web framework such as streamlit.
